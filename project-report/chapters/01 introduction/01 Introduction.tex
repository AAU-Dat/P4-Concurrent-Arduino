\chapter{Introduction}\label{cha:introduction}
This report details the design, definition and implementation of a programming language, as per AAU's fourth semester module description  \cite{AAU_Modules_P4}.

\section{Initial problem}
The problem analysis begins from the project proposal: "A Concurrent Programming Language for Arduino" \cite{Project_Proposals_2022}.\supervisor{What is the best way to cite powerpoint slides from Moodle?}

The proposal outlines how microcontrollers like the Arduino, is used in \gls{cps}

Based on the project proposal, a set of issues have been extracted.




\begin{description}
    \item [Arduino] What it is, who uses it, and the challenges of the standard Arduino programming  model in regards to concurrency/RTS.
    \item [Approaches] Operating systems, scheduling, and differences between the options.
    \item [Scanner/Parser] Generation of code. Or should this be after design? Otherwise, discussion of strengths and weaknesses.
    \item [Compilation] Transpilation and compilation.
\end{description}

\paragraph{HOWEVER,} the content should be considered from the perspective of a programming language, rather than the perspective of computation.
