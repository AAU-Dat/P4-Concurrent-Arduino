\section{Inspiration to our language}
When designing a programming language it is a good idea to look at other programming languages for inspiration. We started by discussing the languages that we all have worked with in former semesters, which is C, JavaScript and C\#. It was also important to check C++ as it was the language, our language should compile to. The discussion in the group was which things the programming languages did well, and what our programming language should include. When discussing these languages there became a common understanding, the programming languages discussed were not intuitive enough for a hobbyist and therefore we needed more research on how other languages did this. Researching then began on looking on more modern and intuitive languages so our programming language would be easier to learn and write in. The languages Dart, Kotlin, Rust, Python and Zyg were all looked at to find the inspiration for our language. One thing we all looked after in the languages was if it had a readable syntax, it did not have to be for whole language, it was only specific ways of writing syntax. Therefore you will see inspiration from many programming languages, when describing ours.  



\subsection{Types}

The types in the language are num, text and bool. A value of the type num is a correct input as long it is a real number. Bool is like the bool in other languages, as it can only be true or false. The type text is an array of characters made by using quotation marks (\") from the start to end of the input. An num array can be made by using squire brackets (\[\]) in front of the type num, how ever an num array can only accept real numbers.

\subsection{Control Structures}
There are ... types of control structures if-,else-,when-statement, while- and for loop. 

A while loop is made by an expression, which evaluates to true or false, as long as the expression is true the while loop executes the statements within the scope, made by curly brackets (\{\}).
