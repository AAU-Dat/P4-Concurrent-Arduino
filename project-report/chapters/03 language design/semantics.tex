\section{Semantics}\label{sec:languagesemantics}
The contextual constraints of Arc specify whether there is meaning in some structure, but the remaining semantics describe the \textit{actual} meaning. Even if a sentence is syntactically and contextually correct, it might be nonsensical according to the semantics. For example, the english sentence "What is the difference between a duck?" is syntactically correct, but not meaningful.

For a complete definition of a programming language, syntax, contextual constraint, and semantics definitions are required. This section describes Arc's important semantics using operational semantics.

\subsection{Number as float}\label{subsec:numberAsFloats}
In our language we have chosen to handle every number as a float. At first glance it looked like a good solution for simplicity. However, as we progressed on the project we discovered that the semantics of floats works differently in relation to mathematics and floating-point arithmetic. As illustrated in Listing~\ref{lst:semanticDifference}, the difference is clearly visible between floats in floating-point arithmetic and mathematics.


\begin{listing}[htb!]
    \begin{minted}[label=Semantic meaning of floats]{text}
        // This is false in floating-point arithmetic but true mathematically.
        0.1 + 0.2 == 0.3
    \end{minted}

This is problematic at best. To the amateur programmers Arc is supposed to cater to this can be both counter intuitve and bothersome, if they are not familiar with floating point arithmetic. This can lead to the programmer expecting a different result from their code and lead to unneccesary frustration. If they expect the code in the example to result to true, they might not even understand how to fix the issue they have created.

\subsection{Important semantic rules of Arc}\label{subsec:importantSemanticRulesOfArc}
One of the reasons we have decided to highlight the expressions for \textbf{and}, \textbf{or} and \textbf{not} falls down to the fact that it is foundational for our Task declaration variant with the when expression. The when expression makes use of a boolean value to decide whether or not it should run the thread - this decision is based on the evaluation of the boolean expressions.
