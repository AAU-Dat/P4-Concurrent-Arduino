\section{Language semantics}\label{sec:languagesemantics}
While syntax describes the structure of the language, semantics describes the \textit{meaning}. Even if a sentence is syntactically correct, it might be nonsensical according to the semantics. For example, the english sentence "What is the difference between a duck?" is syntactically correct, but not meaningful.

For a complete definition of a programming language, both syntax and semantics definitions are required. This section describes the Arc language's important part of the semantics, using operational semantics.




\subsection{Operational semantics}\label{subsec:operationalsemantics}

blocking context of protothreads?
Talk about num and semantics of floats in relation to math? maybe mention memory impact as well.

important semantic rules of Arc:
Tasks of all variants. Perhaps all declarations?
for loop, if statement, and/or/not expressions

Med eksempler

Arrays?
