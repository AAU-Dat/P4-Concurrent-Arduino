\chapter{Language design}\label{cha:languagedesign}
This chapter prioritizes Arc's characteristics based on the criteria from \cite{Sebesta2016}, and briefly covers the parser generators that were considered for the project, as the decision impacted how the language specification was described.

The language specification consisting of the syntax, contextual constraints, and semantics, is also covered in the chapter. Section \ref{sec:syntax} covers



syntax (\ref{sec:syntax}), contextual constraints (\ref{sec:contextualconstraints})

and describes the language specification.

This chapter will describe the design of Arc, the criteria set for it and how it was made. This also includes the discussion of the syntax and semantics, what decisions were made and how they were made.
