\chapter{Language design}\label{cha:languagedesign}
This chapter prioritizes Arc's characteristics based on the criteria from~\cite{Sebesta2016}, and briefly covers the lexer and parser generator tools: \gls{javacc}, \gls{antlr}, and JFlex with Cup, that were considered for the project.

The language specification consisting of the syntax, contextual constraints, and semantics, is also covered in this chapter. Section~\ref{sec:syntax} covers Arc's \gls{cfg} and a description of Arc's types, structures, and constructs. Section~\ref{sec:contextualconstraints} details the scope rules and the type rules, which make up the contextual constraints. Lastly, section~\ref{sec:languagesemantics} outlines Arc's semantics.
