\section{Type checker}
This section will discuss the type checker for Arc, how it is structured and also show examples of how it works.

In Arc, the type checker ensures that types are correct, and if not, throws an error for the user to use and then fix the issue. This would be in cases where a user mistakenly tries to use the plus operand on a num and a char, this will throw an error to the user telling them, that this operation is not valid in Arc.
