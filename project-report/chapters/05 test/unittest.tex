\subsection{Unit test}\label{subsec:unittest}

Plan for creating unit test:

1. First, shortly write about what unit test is? And how unit test come in handy in projects

2. Then write about how we wanted to implement unit test on everything based on the one unit test we already have if the project had went the way we wanted to.

3. In addition to (2.0) you could talk about time saving if some code like in: codegen, typing checking should be change or maked more complex, then just running the test it would show if anything has broken.

4. Talk about how the unit test is structure in three parts and how this structure makes it easier to create unit test.

5. Show the unit test we have and maybe create another or two unit test to show the importance of unit test.

6. Sum
    6.1 We could have been better to wrtie test because it could have helped ud in the last end.
    6.2 Something more.
