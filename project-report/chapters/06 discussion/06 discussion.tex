\chapter{Discussion}\label{cha:discussion}

This chapter will cover the discussion of how well Arc has lived up to the initiating language criteria, and how well the project fulfill the learning goals of the semester.

%--------------------NOTES-------------------------
%Learning goals for semester - Show we have understood them or misunderstood them
%   Have we actually used visitor pattern, if not why?
%Did we live up to our language criteria
%Problem statements
%Arduino
%Should our compiler contain more phases
%Should we have included a front end for our compiler - flags
%Was ANTLR a good tool for us
%   Antlr good for us since we are inexperinced and had to make many changes
%Things we did nnot include in Arc (print and read) - Should we have included it
%   Our example of concurreny languages uses Serial(print) but Arc does not have that.

%What did we do
%Did we live up to our goals and the goals set for us
%What did we not live up to
%   Usability test/general testing - Do we have enough
%   Time constraints or lack of experience
%What could or should we have done differently
%What would we like to improve in the future
%*Do we want to mention tools we used? Github, Discord, Notion, and Teams
%Inlude a code snippet of Protothreads and how it would look in Arc to show difference
    %discuss how Arc differs from Protothreads
%Language looks like C - Why and what impact has that had
    %Arduino works on a subset of C++
%Why did we not use an AST 
%Discuss syntax and why it looks as is does
%Discuss Protothreads vs other libraries for concurrency

%Introduction to discussion section
%Language Design
    %Did we live up to our language criteria
        %Go through all characteristics and determine if Arc follows the priorities made
    %Inlude a code snippet of Protothreads and how it would look in Arc to show difference
        %discuss how Arc differs from Protothreads

%Implementation
    %Was ANTLR a good tool for us

%Test
    %Usability test/general testing - Do we have enough
    %How would we have improved on testing and why did we not
%Future works
    %What would we like to improve in the future
