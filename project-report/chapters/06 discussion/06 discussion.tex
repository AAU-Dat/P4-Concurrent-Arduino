\chapter{discussion}\label{cha:discussion}

This chapter will cover the discussion of how well Arc has lived up to its language criteria, and how well the project lives up to the learning goals for the semester.

%--------------------NOTES-------------------------
%Learning goals for semester - Show we have understood them or misunderstood them
%   Have we actually used visitor pattern, if not why?
%Did we live up to our language criteria
%Problem statements
%Arduino
%Should our compiler contain more phases
%Should we have included a front end for our compiler - flags
%Was ANTLR a good tool for us
%   Antlr good for us since we are inexperinced and had to make many changes
%Things we did nnot include in Arc (print and read) - Should we have included it
%   Our example of concurreny languages uses Serial(print) but Arc does not have that.

%What did we do
%Did we live up to our goals and the goals set for us
%What did we not live up to
%   Usability test/general testing - Do we have enough
%   Time constraints or lack of experience
%What could or should we have done differently
%What would we like to improve in the future
%*Do we want to mention tools we used? Github, Discord, Notion, and Teams
%Inlude a code snippet of Protothreads and how it would look in Arc to show difference
    %discuss how Arc differs from Protothreads

%Language Design
    %Did we live up to our language criteria
        %Go through all characteristics and determine if Arc follows the priorities made
    %Inlude a code snippet of Protothreads and how it would look in Arc to show difference
        %discuss how Arc differs from Protothreads
