\section{Usability test}
This section will discuss the usability tests of Arc, what could have been done differently and what impact it would have had on Arc. Since no actual usability tests were conducted on Arc, it is difficult to anticipte what the results would mean for the development and design. Currently only a speculation of how to test could be conducted has been made, for now tests for readability and writeability of Arc have been theorized. The results of these test would give insight in how actual users interact with the syntax of Arc, where it is lacking and what should be considered for improvement. 

The readability test consists of users being given some Arc code, and for them to explain what is happening. The users would be categorized by their previouse experience of coding. This was thought to be a simple test, that would give insight to what is ealisy understood by users of different levels of experience. Other ways of testing readability could have been considered, such as showing some syntax of Arc, eplaining what it means, and ask a test participant if the syntax makes sense and what they might want to change. This way of testing might give a more indepth analysis of the readability, but could also be biased as the syntax would be explained before they could make their own assumptions of the meaning. This way of testing the readability, would also complicate the analysis of the results, as there is not a clear yes or no answer to the readability of the example, as there is with the current way of testing. Ofcourse there are many different ways of doing this type of test, but for the context of Arc, the current way of testing is deemed suitable for the wanted results.

Writability tests of Arc, were made simillar to the readability tests. Participants are given a task they must create, based on what they saw in the readability test. This test seemed as a good option for testing the writeability of Arc, but many things should be considered for this. Some participants might not understand what the task they are to make, must do. Also for people who have never coded before, this test might not test Arcs writeability, but more a test in their ability to understand the assignment and creating a programmatic soluition. 

Calculating the cost of Arc, would change depending on what type of data the readability and writability tests return. One thing that might help some users, and reduce cost, would be to include documentation, instead of only examples. This could help guide some users, that prefer reading through documentation, to learn a new programming language. 

Usability tests need a lot of consideration, and since Arc only has theoretical usability tests, it is difficult to have a proper discussion about the outcome of them and what could have been done differently. 
Although it is clear, that usability tests could have been a good idea, but the time needed for creating, arranging and analyzing them, far exceeds what was avaliable. For this reason, it was deemed apropriate to only make use of theoretical usability tests, that can then be made use of in the future.
