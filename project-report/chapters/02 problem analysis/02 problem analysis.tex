\chapter{Problem analysis}\label{cha:problemanalysis}
This chapter details the problem analysis, from the initial problem to a problem statement. Based on the initial problem, a set of questions to research during the problem analysis has been determined:

\begin{description}
    \item[Arduino] What is Arduino, and who uses it? What is the Arduino programming language?
    \item[Concurrency] What is concurrency, and what does it mean to work concurrently? What are the different approaches/models for concurrency, and what are the challenges in relation to Arduino?
\end{description}
