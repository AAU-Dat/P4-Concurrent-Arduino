\section{What is the problem}\label{sec:whatistheproblem}
The problem we will try to  solve in this project is an extension for hobbyists\todo{Giovanni: ??} working on Arduino, concurrency and real-time systems \todo{Real-time systems has never been mentioned}. The problem is based on hobbyists having trouble implementing concurrency simply and effectively without getting into the nitty-gritty details, that a hobbyist does not want to deal with. It is also based on many tutorials, which have implementations containing bad practices.% Examples of this can be seen here() /and here where they implement things like interrupt which is not a good way to do concurrency.(explain interupts)

This has led us to the problem we want to try and solve, hobbyists have a hard time using concurrency easily on Arduino. We will try to solve this by creating a programming language for hobbyists to easily and correctly implement concurrency on their Arduino devices. Therefore our problem statement is:

How can you create a programming language that would allow a hobby-level user of Arduino to use concurrency easily and correctly concerning the best Arduino concurrency practices?
