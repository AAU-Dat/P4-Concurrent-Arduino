\section{Problem statement}\label{sec:problemstatement}
Concurrency is a complex subject, and something that has to be studied deeply by programmers~\cite{Sebesta2016}. It can't be expected for a hobbyist to study concurrency in its entirety for hobby projects - unless they are programmers or computer scientists - the scope is too large for most hobbyist projects.

Many languages include constructs to abstract some details of concurrency away, to make it easier to write concurrent programs. The Arduino programming language does not, which complicates the process of writing concurrent programs in the Arduino language.

For these reasons, hobbyists often face many difficulties when writing concurrent programs for the Arduino, which may be solved easily in other programming languages. Therefore the problem statement for this project is as follows:

\blockquote{To create a programming language for the Arduino with a set of intuitive constructs, that leverages the Protothreads library to concisely expresses a concurrent flow of control.}



%To create a programming language for the Arduino, that leverages the Protothreads library to concisely express a concurrent and intuitive flow of control.

%\blockquote{To create a programming language with superficial and easy to understand and use constructs, that can be used to concisely express }

%To create a programming language for the Arduino, with easy to understand and use constructs, that can be used to concisely express concurrent 

%\blockquote{To create an extension on the Arduino programming language to support concurrency in real-time systems. The language should aid hobbyists in writing idiomatic Arduino programs.}

%\blockquote{To create a programming language for Arduino, which leverages some concurrency mechanism, to make it simpler or easier for hobbyists to write idiomatic Arduino programs with concurrency.}
