\section{Problem statement}\label{sec:problemstatement}
\urgent{unfinished section. We want only one problem statement, and preferably some references to previous choices}
The problem statement goes here. Temporary problem statement (Probably a full language, rather than an extension):

\blockquote{To create an extension on the Arduino programming language to support concurrency in real-time systems. The language should aid hobbyists in writing idiomatic Arduino programs.}

\subsection{Second attempt}

\blockquote{To create a programming language for Arduino, which leverages some concurrency mechanism, to make it simpler or easier for hobbyists to write idiomatic Arduino programs with concurrency.}
